1) Pulls data from any crypto API and converts the data into a DataFrame.

2) Uses the Dataframe to generate buy and sell signals in the crypto markets based upon multiple algorithms 

3) Displays the visuals of buy and sell signals across the historical data using Streamlit

4) Lastly append the buy/sell signals into a SQL database so as to imitate the process of a data ingestion team

5) Backtest to see if any strategies perform better within these higher volatility markets



Step 1:

In Terminal create a new conda environment:

*conda create --name krakenite python=3.7*

*conda activate krakenite*


pip install pandas
conda install matplotlib
pip install hvplot
pip install pykrakenapi


Reading about Jim Simons has lead me to believe that algorithms will win the crypto markets but simply cleaning data, backtesting, and applying a scenario is not enough.
